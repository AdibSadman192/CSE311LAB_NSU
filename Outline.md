GENERAL OVERVIEW
The lab course aims to make students able to apply their knowledge in developing and using relational databases. The labs cover efficient use of SQL for complicated tasks and teach a database language. The main topics of the laboratory applications are: SQL Queries (both simple & advanced), use of triggers, stored procedures and functions for efficient and more secure implementations of database applications. Upon completion of the course, the students learn how to design and develop database applications using one of the major DBMSs.

These labs are not just for students who require extra help; they are an integral part of the course and attendance is mandatory. 

To be successful, you will need to devote significant time outside of Labs to studying, practicing skills and solving assignment problems.
